variables:
pitch_number = pitch number in game
pitch_rpm = total pitch spin (rpm)
pitch_spin_direction = degree equivalent of spin tilt (degrees)
pitch_spin_tilt = spin axis in time equivalent
pitch_vb = absolute pitch vertical break (in)
pitch_vb_ind = relative (spin inducded) vertical break (in)
pitch_hb = absolute horizontal break (in)
plate_z = height of ball in strike zone (ft)
plate_x = left/right position of ball in strike zone, 0 is middle of plate (ft)
pfx_x = movement at 40 ft, inches (?)
pfx_z = movement at 40 ft, inches (?)
x0 = location at 50 ft, feet
y0 = location at 50 ft, feet
z0 = location at 50 ft, feet
vx0 = velo at 50 ft, ft/s
vy0 = velo at 50 ft, ft/s
vz0 = velo at 50 ft, ft/s
ax0 = accel at 50 ft, ft/s/s
ay0 = accel at 50 ft, ft/s/s
px = catcher view strike zone, ft  
pz = catcher view strike zone, ft 

notes:

use px, pz have less na's than plate_x, plate_z but only for pitches with an extreme location value. so still use plate_x, plate_z

very strong relation between mvmt_diff (pitch_vb_ind - pitch_vb) and pitch speed (power law?)

spin direction and tilt are same, 12:00 = 180 degrees 

pitch_vb a measure, pitch_vb_ind infered?

vx0, vy0, vz0 in feet per second
